## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

git clone https://github.com/SiroDaves/SongLib-iOS.git
cd SongLib-iOS
```

### 2. Set up Supabase Environment

Create your environment file by copying the example:

cp .env.example .env
```

Then, fill in the `.env` file with your Supabase credentials (API URL, anon/public key, etc.)

---

### 3. Open in Xcode

```bash
open SwahiLib.xcodeproj
```

Or open `SwahiLib.xcworkspace` if you're using CocoaPods or other workspace-based dependency managers.

### 4. Install Dependencies

Ensure you have [CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org/) or use Swift Package Manager. If using CocoaPods:

```bash
pod install
```

Or if using Swift Package Manager, just build the project in Xcode and it will fetch the packages.

### 5. Build and Run

Select the correct simulator or your iOS device in Xcode, then hit:

```
Cmd + R
```

## 💡 Notes

* The app uses Core Data to cache and persist content for offline usage.
* Supabase is used for syncing and querying the latest content.
* For development and testing, you can mock network calls or pre-load your Core Data store.
